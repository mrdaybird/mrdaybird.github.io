Well, as you would have already noticed by own, the website is a Work-in-Progress. I not completely happy with the current look and feel of the website, though I have put it out there to because not having a website was holding me back from putting my writings out there. 

## Reach out to me

I can be found on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mrv_daybird), you can message me directly there if you want.
You can also check out my [github](https://github.com/mrdaybird), it's nothing special, but in the making.

## About the website

The goal with this website is to 'write more'. I do consume a lot of content, from books to blogs to videos, and there are some livelong learning in them, so I want to produce some high quality notes about things I liked and learned. This way I can improve my writing skills as well as make myself some good notes, it's a win-win situation for me.
