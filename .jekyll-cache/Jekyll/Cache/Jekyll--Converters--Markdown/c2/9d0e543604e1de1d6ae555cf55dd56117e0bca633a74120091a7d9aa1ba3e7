I"Ô<p>Well, as you would have already noticed by own, the website is a Work-in-Progress. I not completely happy with the current look and feel of the website, though I have put it out there to because not having a website was holding me back from putting my writings out there.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-website">About the website</h2>

<p>The goal with this website is to 'write more'. I do consume a lot of content, from books to blogs to videos, and there are some livelong learning in them, so I want to produce some high quality notes about things I liked and learned. This way I can improve my writing skills as well as make myself some good notes, it's a win-win situation for me.</p>
